NOTES! on boids:

half size of objects (make the space seem less enclosed) - DONE

Get Boids to avoid walls (apply a force to the boid the closer they are to the wall) - DONE

Get Boids to avoid bullets (use the bullet script to apply a force away from the bullet to nearby boids)

Limit the player to the play area

Limit boids to futher up the screen as they're still quite close to the player.
